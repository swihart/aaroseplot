Title: Area Adjusted Roseplots via ggplot2

Description: In ggplot2's documentation, the roseplot is derived by taking a
    barchart and mapping it to polar coordinates.  In a bar chart, the height
    of the bar equals the area if the width is 1.  In polar coordinates, the
    resulting sector (wedge, pie slice, etc) has a radius equal to the bar of
    the barchart, which results in the area being squarely proportional to the
    radius.  In area adjusted roseplots, the area of the wedge is the value we
    want to portray, so we back calculate the radius that gives that area.
    This is not a novel idea, as the coxcomb and Florence Nightingale's work
    predates this work (understandinguncertainty.org/coxcombs).
